Who am I?:

I am a software engineer working in JavaScript and learning Tailwind and React to strengthen my skills and increase my learning velocity.

Currently I am searching for my first role in the technology field.

When I'm not coding I can be found riding my bike in Birmingham as I am an avid cyclist.
