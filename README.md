Who am I?:

I am a software engineer working in C# and the .Net framework to build projects that showcase my abilities to create reliable APIs.

Currently I am searching for my first role in the technology field.

When I'm not coding I can be found riding my bike in Birmingham as I am an avid cyclist.
